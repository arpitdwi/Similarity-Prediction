To run the code in Colab the dataset needs to be downloaded from Kaggle onto the local Colab VM. 
This can be done by executing the code at the beginning of the .ipynb file
Upon execution it will ask for the API token which can be obtained from the respective Kaggle account.
All the steps have been summarised here: - https://www.kaggle.com/general/74235

The model takes some time to train for 5 epochs.
For testing the zip file 'test-img' attached along with this term project submission needs to be uploaded as well.
Several images of different animals have been included in the test dataset and upon uncommenting each line in the last code block, the resultant output can be generated.
The performance may vary slightly depending on the convergence of the loss function each time the model is trained.
